## Pre-requisites

1. You need know how to use SUMO.
   
   You may find [my tutorial](https://github.com/DayuanTan/SUMO_Guide_with_Examples) is helpful for beginners. I suggest you go over it before you continue.

2. You are suggested to read our paper to understand the algorithms. 
   Our paper includes 3 algorithms. The static TL and ATL are easy to understand. Our PALM may be a little complex.

## Code

This code includes our implementations of those 3 algorithms: 
- Static Traffic Light Control System
- Actuated Traffic Light Control System
- PALM

and detialed steps and explanations.

To see the code, please read this [Readme](code/ReadMe.md). 

## Code Completeness

- Static Traffic Light Control System: 100%
  - You should be able to run it successfully.
- Actuated Traffic Light Control System: 100%
  - You should be able to run it successfully.
- PALM: 99%. 
  - My laptop was broken. The code I stored on cloud doesn't have the newest version. But it is super close to the newest version. I lost about 2 or 3 days updates.
  - I thought about fixing it. But the priority of this fix task is low.  
  - I cannot gurantee you can run it. But the code are still very valuabble, especially I provide the very detialed steps and explanations of my code. It's enough for you to understand how to implement it and develop your algorithm.
